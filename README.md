# What this is
This is an interactive counting app made using HTML, CSS and JavaScript. It is based off Scrimbas Build a Passenger Counter app. I changed the code to use EventListeners instead of onClick. I also added a new feature to decrease the counter.

# Upcoming Features
I have a few features I would like to add. 
- A convert to `.txt` button which sends all the values to a `.txt` file. 

- A revert to 0 option in case one wishes to start counting again, without saving.

# Live Preview
